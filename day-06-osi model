# OSI Model – Explained Layer by Layer

Today I learned about the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model**, which explains how data is transmitted from one system to another in a network. The OSI model is divided into **7 layers**, and each layer has a specific responsibility.

Understanding the OSI model is very important for **networking, cybersecurity, troubleshooting, and ethical hacking**.

## What is the OSI Model?

The OSI Model is a **conceptual framework** that standardizes network communication into seven layers.  
Each layer performs a specific task and passes data to the next layer.

## OSI Model Layers (Top to Bottom)

### 7. Application Layer
- Closest layer to the end user
- Provides network services to applications
- User directly interacts with this layer

**Examples:**
- HTTP / HTTPS
- FTP
- SMTP
- DNS
- SSH

**Use case:**  
Accessing a website using a browser

---

### 6. Presentation Layer
- Translates data into a readable format
- Handles **encryption and decryption**
- Handles data compression

**Examples:**
- SSL / TLS
- JPEG, MP4, PNG formats

**Use case:**  
Encrypting data during HTTPS communication

---

### 5. Session Layer
- Manages sessions between systems
- Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections
- Handles authentication and session recovery

**Use case:**  
Staying logged into a website during a session

---

### 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures reliable or fast data delivery
- Controls data flow and error handling
- Uses **port numbers**

**Protocols:**
- TCP (Reliable, connection-oriented)
- UDP (Fast, connectionless)

**Examples:**
- HTTP → Port 80
- HTTPS → Port 443
- SSH → Port 22

---

### 3. Network Layer
- Responsible for routing and logical addressing
- Uses **IP addresses**
- Determines the best path for data

**Protocols:**
- IP (IPv4 / IPv6)
- ICMP

**Devices:**  
Routers


 2. Data Link Layer
- Transfers data within the same network
- Uses **MAC addresses**
- Converts packets into frames
- Error detection using CRC

**Examples:**
- Ethernet
- ARP
- Switches operate at this layer


 1. Physical Layer
- Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s)
- Deals with physical media and signals

**Examples:**
- Ethernet cables
- Fiber optics
- Wi-Fi radio signals
- Network Interface Cards (NIC)

1. Physical  
2. Data Link  
3. Network  
4. Transport  
5. Session  
6. Presentation  
7. Application

## Why the OSI Model is Important

- Helps in **network troubleshooting**
- Used in **cybersecurity and ethical hacking**
- Makes it easy to understand **where attacks occur**
- Commonly asked in **interviews and exams**

## Conclusion

The OSI Model is not outdated.  
It is a **foundational concept** that helps understand how networks function internally.  
Every networking and cybersecurity professional should understand this model clearly.
