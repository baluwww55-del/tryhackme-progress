# Linux Fundamentals – Day 01 (TryHackMe)

Today I learned Linux fundamentals using TryHackMe as part of my Cyber Security learning journey. Linux is a core skill for ethical hacking, system administration, and blue team operations.

Linux is a command-line–driven operating system where most tasks are performed using terminal commands. Understanding basic navigation, file handling, user management, and searching is essential.

Commands learned today:

pwd – print current working directory  
ls – list files and directories  
ls -la – list all files including hidden files with permissions  
cd folder_name – change directory  
cd .. – move to parent directory  

touch file.txt – create a file  
mkdir folder – create a directory  
rm file.txt – delete a file  
rm -r folder – delete a directory  
cp source.txt destination.txt – copy files  
mv oldname.txt newname.txt – rename or move files  

cat file.txt – display file contents  
less file.txt – view file with scrolling  
head file.txt – show first 10 lines  
tail file.txt – show last 10 lines  

find / -name file.txt – search for a file  
grep "text" file.txt – search text inside a file  
grep THM access.log – find flags in log files  

whoami – show current user  
id – display user ID and groups  
uname -a – display system information  

echo "TryHackMe" > file.txt – overwrite file content  
echo "password123" > passwords – replace file content  
echo "Hello Linux" >> file.txt – append content to file  

Key takeaways:
Linux is powerful and efficient when used from the terminal. File paths, permissions, and logs play a critical role in cyber security. Mastering basic commands is the foundation for advanced hacking and defensive techniques.

Next steps:
Learn Linux permissions (chmod, chown), practice log analysis, explore bash scripting, and continue TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals Part 2.
