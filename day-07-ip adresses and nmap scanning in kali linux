# IPv4, IPv6 and Nmap Scanning using Kali Linux

## What is an IP Address
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to every device on a network.  
It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

Without an IP address, data would not know where to go.

---

## IPv4

IPv4 is the most commonly used IP addressing system.

It is a 32-bit address written in decimal format.

Example:
192.168.1.1

It contains 4 octets separated by dots.  
Each octet ranges from 0 to 255.

Total IPv4 addresses:
About 4.3 billion.

### Private IPv4 ranges
Used in local networks:

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255  

These are the ranges we usually scan in Kali Linux labs.

## IPv6

IPv6 is the newer version of IP addressing created because IPv4 addresses were running out.

It is a 128-bit address written in hexadecimal.

Example:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Advantages:
- Very large number of addresses  
- Better efficiency  
- Improved routing  
- Built for future networks  

---

## Public vs Private IP

Public IP:
Assigned by ISP and visible on the internet.

Private IP:
Used inside local networks and labs.

Example:
192.168.1.5

Most Nmap practice scanning is done on private IP ranges.

## What is Nmap

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanning tool used for:

- Discovering devices on a network  
- Finding open ports  
- Detecting services  
- Security testing  
- Network mapping  

It sends packets to an IP address and analyzes responses.

Kali Linux comes with Nmap preinstalled.

Check version:
nmap --version

## How Nmap Uses IP Addresses

Nmap requires a target IP or network range.

Scan single IP:
nmap 192.168.1.1

Scan full network:
nmap 192.168.1.0/24

This scans all devices in that subnet.

---

## Common Nmap Commands

Basic scan:
nmap <ip>

Host discovery:
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

SYN scan:
nmap -sS <ip>

Service version detection:
nmap -sV <ip>

OS detection:
nmap -O <ip>

Aggressive scan:
nmap -A <ip>

---

## Example Lab Scan

Step 1: Find your IP
ip a

Step 2: Scan network
nmap 192.168.1.0/24

Step 3: Scan specific device
nmap -sV 192.168.1.5

---

## What Nmap Can Detect

- Active hosts  
- Open ports  
- Running services  
- Operating system  
- Network structure  

This helps understand network security and configuration.

---

## Important Note

Use Nmap only on:
- Your own lab  
- Practice environments  
- Networks you have permission to scan  

Unauthorized scanning can be illegal.

## Conclusion

Today I learned:

- What IPv4 and IPv6 are  
- How IP addressing works  
- How Nmap scans networks  
- How to perform basic scans in Kali Linux  

Understanding IP addresses and Nmap is a fundamental skill in networking and cybersecurity.
